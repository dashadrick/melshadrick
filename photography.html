<h1>	A SUMMER WITH BARKBOX </h1>
<p> I spent two months ( 21 days _ hours _ seconds) living in the upper west village of Manhattan and commuting to and from the head quarter of BARK BOX - a subscription based e-commerce and content company for dogs. I was brought on to work with Stacie Grissom (Bark’s Head of Content) and Ilan Nass (Bark’s Head of Marketing for SuperChewer) on an SEO project to help show the company why BarkPost (the companies blog) could help drive profitably through increasing viisblity in SERP rankings. I was responsible for both crafting the content to be ranked, optimizing it for SEO, and building a series of backlinks to increase the articles relevance according to google algorithms. To do so I utilized a series of tools including Google Analytics, SEMRush, AWRCloud, Ahrefs, and many more. As well as managing a team of 2-8 at a time through the platform UPWork, responsible fo the vetting, testing, hiring, and then management of this team.

During my time at BARK I took the keyword “Best Dog Toy’s” and tracked what made the articles ranking for that key term successfully an worked to implement them in my own article “31 best dog toys of 2019”. Ontop of carefully formatting that content I started a series of influencer ouchreach tactics. Using Bark’s authority in the pet space to get my foot in the door I spent my time mangaing hundreds of emails a day creating carefully formatted cadences to allow follow up emails all while making make sure the content was relevant and not overtly spam.  </p>
