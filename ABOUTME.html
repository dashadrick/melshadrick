		<p> So if you’re reading this I’m going to assume you clicked on this page for one reason — you want to know more about me. If that’s not the case you have successfully wandered onto my life story. We’re glad to have you here, please take a seat and enjoy the ride.

Let’s start with the basics:

My name is Melissa Shadrick. I’m a 20-year-old suburban Chicago native living out her college years among the cornfields of Ohio (as a student at Miami University). Currently, I’m a sophomore at Miami majoring in Strategic Communications and Interactive Media Studies – with a concentration in digital business/digital marketing.

Now let’s jump into the real stuff! Who really is Melissa?

Well. I’m an interesting mix of creative and driven, with a series of interests ranging far and wide. Among the many, some of my interests include equestrian sports, graphic design, photography, video production/editing, writing, travel, and nutrition. I’ve been a competitive horseback rider for the past ten years, something I still absolutely adore and participate in today (as a member of the Miami University Equestrian Team). As an active member of the team, I am also on the board of the teams Public Relations Committee where we help produce content to promote the team as well as design apparel graphics. I’ve also attempted to keep up graphic design — a hobby I love — through the production of promotional material for my sorority Chi Omega. Making time to pursue my hobbies is central to my work ethic, with a quite rigorous class load and as a member of 4 different clubs finding time to relax can be sparse but always enjoyable.
