<div class= "name"> Why Interactive Media Studies? </div>
  	<div class="YIKES">
<p>I'll be honest, when I first came to Miami I had absolutely no idea what Interactive Media Studies was (or that it even existed at the university in general). So I bumbled around that first semester freshman year, lazily exploring potential second majors/co-majors to fulfill my Strategic Communications double major requirement. Still, nothing intrigued me. I felt discouraged,  I knew what I was interested in but I just couldn't find a track that accompanied both my interests and passions. Then as it happens, I stumbled upon something exciting.

 It was December and I was driving through the snow covered corn fields, on my way home to Chicago after my first semester at college. I was understandably bored, the six hour road trip wearing on my tired mind. So I opened up my podcasts app, looking for something to keep me awake. It so happened that a podcast I listen to frequently popped up an episode titled " Are you ready for"The Intimacy Economy" ?" featuring Miami University professor Glenn Platt. You could imagine my surprise when, upon listening to the podcast, professor Platt preceded to describe AIMS (the Armstrong Institute for Interactive Media Studies) a college within the university I had never even heard of.  After that I was hooked, after I arrived home I spent the rest of break looking into IMS - dumbfounded (and slightly disappointed) at how I hadn't found it sooner.

So thats how I found IMS but the real question is, why IMS?

Well, once I found out what IMS was, it was no question to me that IMS was a major I wanted to pursue. The major itself was a combination of a grouping of some of my biggest interests. IMS would allow me to  incorporate my love of the digital world working cross-platforms, combing technology, business and design -- all in one place. If you've read my about page you'd notice a concentration in the digital arts (Photoshop, Final Cut Pro, HTML)  as well as the markeing field (PRSSA membership, Hub-spot certifications). Personally from what I've seen of the IMS curriculum I believe this major would allow me to fully encompass all my interests, allowing me to earn a degree in something i'm both interested in and passionate about.
